# VOLTAGE REGULATED RFID LOCK
a) To Design a RFID based Lock using the basic Knowledge  ofMicrocontrollers, Sensors and Actuators. 

b) To Design a circuit that meets the voltage requirements of the solenoid lock

## ABSTRACT
RFID is a short form of Radio Frequency Identification. It is working under inductive coupling principle, based on a radio frequency or radio waves. RIFDs uses electromagnetic field to identify objective or tracking the objects automatically even 100 meters distance.

The objectives may be books, products in shopping malls, cars etc., not only objects it can be used for tracking of Pet animals also. The RFID tag is used to attach to the object which we want to track. This RFID reader are designed to send the data automatically in real time. Also we can change the value in the real time.
